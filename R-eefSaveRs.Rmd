## Introduction
Coral reefs are one of the most magnificent and ecologically important ecosystems on the planet. They are extremely biodiverse, with 32 of the 35 known animal phyla found within them. Importantly, it is approximated that 25% of all marine life are dependent on coral reefs at some point in their life cycles. Overall, coral reefs are an irreplaceable ecosystem, playing an important role in species diversity, productivity, fisheries, coastal protection, human health and livelihoods, and more.

Corals are communal organisms, composed of a colony of polyps. They have also evolved a mutualistic, symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae which give corals their distinct colors. Corals provide environmental protection and compounds necessary for photosynthesis, such as carbon dioxide and ammonium, to zooxanthellae, while zooxanthellae provide glucose, glycerol, oxygen, and amino acids for corals. This relationship is quite sensitive and is unfortunately under threat due to a multitude of stressors. In particular, bleaching is affecting coral reefs across the globe. When reefs experience increased light and higher water temperature, zooxanthellae produce charged oxygen molecules (O-). Unfortunately, these charged oxygen molecules are toxic to corals which leads them to expel their zooxanthellae. While corals can survive a bleaching event, they are under more stress without their symbiotic partners and are subject to increased mortality. Collapse of the coral reefs puts the entire ecosystem at risk.

Previous research by @berkelmans1999large found that the Great Barrier Reef in Australia experienced its greatest coral bleaching event in 1998. Aerial studies found that 87% of inshore reefs were bleached at least to some extent (>1% of coral cover). 67% had high levels of bleaching (>10% of coral) and 25% of isnhore reefs had extreme levels of bleaching (>60% of coral). Here we find concrete evidence that global change is impacting coral reefs, acting swiftly and intensely. Another study by @pratchett2011changes directly linked this bleaching event with changes in reef biodiversity, finding a relationship between decreased reef health and declining fish species abundance. We hope to look at the long term affects of this event as well as any additional bleaching occurring from 2000 to 2023.

Our analysis seeks to analyze the affect of coral reef health, measured by amount of bleaching, on species abundance and occurrence, used as a proxy for ecosystem biodiversity. Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support life on Earth, so we find it to be an important measurement, especially in such a key marine ecosystem. We hope our findings can be used to institute effective and adaptive management strategies and policies to protect coral reefs. Details on the chosen area of study and selected species can be found below.

## Methodology
- Coral Reef Health Data: Sourced from comprehensive databases (@donner2017new), this data includes information on coral bleaching events, severity codes, and geographical locations within the reef.
- Fish Occurrence Data: Accessed using the rgbif package, this data represents observations of various marine species within Australian waters, focusing on the Great Barrier Reef.
Data Processing
- The data was filtered, processed, and categorized into different time ranges (1980-1990, 1991-2000, 2001-2010).
- Observation counts for each species were tallied, and the data was mapped to visualize the distribution of severity codes and species occurrence.

#### Areas and Species of Study
The area we have chosen to study is the Great Barrier Reef, found off the eastern coast of Australia near Queensland. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, containing over 2,900 individual reefs and boasting over 400 types of coral as well over 9,000 known species. Additionally, the reef's popularity means that it has been well studied and recorded by researchers and citizen scientists alike. These factors make the Great Barrier Reef a perfect region of study.

Below you will find descriptions on our selected species:

## Species Included in this Study
```{r spec, include=TRUE}

```

### Triaenodon obesus (Whitetip Reef Shark)

<img src="https://www.aquariumofpacific.org/images/olc/nwhi-sharknoaac.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

**Triaenodon obesus**, commonly known as the *Whitetip Reef Shark*, is one of the most prevalent sharks found in the reefs of the Indo-Pacific region. These sharks are notable for their reliance on reef caves as resting spots during the day. As apex predators, they play a crucial role in the reef ecosystem, preying on a variety of species.


### Tridacna gigas (Giant Clam)

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Giant_clam_or_Tridacna_gigas.jpg/520px-Giant_clam_or_Tridacna_gigas.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

**Tridacna gigas**, also known as the *Giant Clam*, is one of the most endangered clam species. Native to shallow coral reefs, their immobility in adult stages makes them particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. They maintain a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, deriving most of their nutrition from this algal partner.

### Chaetodon rainfordi (Rainford's Butterflyfish)

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/ChaetodRainfordiMarkMShepherd.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

**Chaetodon rainfordi**, or *Rainford's Butterflyfish*, is native to the southwestern Pacific Ocean, including the Great Barrier Reef. As an obligate corallivore, it feeds exclusively on coral polyps, making it a valuable indicator species for local coral health.

### Abudefduf vaigiensis (Indo-Pacific Sergeant)

<img src="https://media.australian.museum/media/dd/images/avaigiensis_big.6e7311e.width-1200.067fecd.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The *Indo-Pacific Sergeant*, or **Abudefduf vaigiensis**, is a damselfish that inhabits the Indo-Pacific region. It relies on coral reefs throughout its adult life.

### Cephalopholis miniata (Coral Hind)

<img src="https://seaunseen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MG_8098.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The *Coral Grouper*, known scientifically as **Cephalopholis miniata**, prefers more exposed areas of the reef. This predatory species feeds on small fish and crustaceans.

### Chlorurus sordidus (Bullethead Parrotfish)

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Chlorurus_sordidus_by_Jaroslaw_Barski.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

**Chlorurus sordidus**, or the *Daisy Parrotfish*, is found in coral reefs where it feeds on benthic algae. Parrotfish play a crucial role in maintaining reef health by scraping algae off dead coral substrates and producing sand from ingested rock and coral.

    cat("\nModel for Species:", sp, "\n")
    print(summary(models[[sp]]))
}

```

#### Interpretation

The linear mixed-effects models demonstrate varied relationships between observation_count and SEVERITY_CODE across species, factoring in reef_zone as a random effect. For Abudefduf vaigiensis (SEVERITY_CODE estimate: -0.05199, reef_zone variance: 82.07) and Cephalopholis miniata (SEVERITY_CODE estimate: -0.0571, reef_zone variance: 6.020), there is a slight negative relationship, suggesting minor reductions in observation counts with increasing severity codes. More pronounced effects are seen in Chaetodon rainfordi (SEVERITY_CODE estimate: -2.7551, reef_zone variance: 355.7) and Chlorurus sordidus (SEVERITY_CODE estimate: -7.030, reef_zone variance: 1251), with the latter showing a substantial decrease in observation counts correlating with higher severity codes, indicating significant ecological impacts.

Conversely, Triaenodon obesus exhibits a very minimal negative effect (SEVERITY_CODE estimate: -0.005411) with a singular fit in the model, suggesting potential model fitting issues or lack of data variation. Tridacna gigas shows a moderate negative relationship (SEVERITY_CODE estimate: -0.07546) with relatively low variability across reef zones (reef_zone variance: 0.008205). These species-specific findings highlight the complexity of ecological dynamics within coral reef ecosystems. The variability in response to environmental severity underscores the need for nuanced, species-specific analyses in marine biodiversity studies, considering the distinct ecological roles and sensitivities of different species within reef environments.


### Including Species as a Fixed Effect
```{r species fixed, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
model <- lmer(observation_count ~ SEVERITY_CODE + species + (1 | reef_zone), data = longer_data)

summary(model)
anova(model)
```

#### Interpretation
The model, represented by the formula observation_count ~ SEVERITY_CODE + species + (1 | reef_zone), demonstrates a significant overall negative relationship between severity codes and observation counts, as indicated by the SEVERITY_CODE coefficient of -1.6958. This suggests that an increase in severity code, indicative of more severe environmental conditions, generally leads to a decrease in observation counts across all species. The model's intercept is set at 8.1568, serving as a baseline for observation counts when other variables are held constant.

Species-specific variations are evident in the model, with certain species showing distinct deviations from the baseline observation counts. For example, speciesChaetodon rainfordi exhibits a substantial increase in observation counts (coefficient: 28.6941), indicating a higher number of observations compared to other species under similar environmental conditions. In contrast, speciesCephalopholis miniata shows a negative deviation from the baseline (coefficient: -4.1461), suggesting fewer observations. The random effects for reef_zone reveal a variance of 107.9, pointing to significant differences in observation counts across various reef zones, which highlights the spatial heterogeneity within reef ecosystems. These findings underscore the complex and nuanced responses of different marine species to varying environmental conditions, emphasizing the need for species-specific conservation and management strategies in coral reef ecosystems.

## ANOVA Analysis

```{r anova, include=TRUE}
library(lmerTest)

# Loop through each model and perform ANOVA
for (species in names(models)) {
  cat("\nPerforming ANOVA for Species:", species, "\n")
  
  # Perform ANOVA on the model using lmerTest
  anova_result <- anova(models[[species]])
  
  # Calculate the p-value from the F-value and degrees of freedom
  p_value <- 1 - pf(anova_result$`F value`, anova_result$`npar`, anova_result$`npar`)
  
  # Print the ANOVA result with p-values
  cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")
}

## Discussion
This study's findings provide a nuanced perspective on the relationship between environmental severity and marine biodiversity in coral reef ecosystems. Utilizing ANOVA to assess various species models, including Abudefduf vaigiensis, Cephalopholis miniata, Chaetodon rainfordi, Chlorurus sordidus, Triaenodon obesus, and Tridacna gigas, the research identified distinct responses among species. However, the p-values, which ranged from 0.1101832 to 0.6900801, indicate that these differences are not statistically significant. This lack of significance suggests a more complex interplay between environmental factors and species responses than initially hypothesized. This complexity further underscores the intricacy of coral reef ecosystems and signals the need for more in-depth investigation to inform effective conservation strategies. The study also emphasizes the importance of considering geographical variability in reef health assessments. Overall, while the study does not find statistically significant impacts of environmental severity on specific species, it provides critical insights into the potential resilience and vulnerability of coral reefs, underscoring the need for comprehensive and nuanced approaches in future conservation efforts.
